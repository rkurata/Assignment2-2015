===========

Instructions are in the wiki.

Design Principles:

1. Used feedback/contrast to let users know what page they're currently on in the nav bar at the top. This is done by using contrasting colors to bring attention to the current page. Keeping the button white provides contrast, which makes it stand out from the other buttons.

2. Used knowledge that users typically scan pages for information. For the homepage (/account) I kept the information organized hierarchically by using different sized headers, and I kept the information very concise. 

3. Kept the user's goal in mind (their goal is to navigate from the /account page to the different visualizations). In order to make it easy for users to navigate to the different visualizations, I made the four navigation buttons the main focus of the homepage. They are also grouped, so that the boilerplate visualizations are one group and the newly created visualizations are another group. This is done by keeping the vertical gap much larger than the horizontal gaps between the buttons. This will make it easier for the grader to identify which pages I made.

4. Prevent errors/permit easy reveral of actions: this is done by keeping the navigation buttons consistent across all the visualization pages. If a user wants to leave the current page and visit another one, they can easily do so.

5. Minimal design: the design was kept minimal in order to keep the focus on the visualizations. There are no distracting backgrounds, so that the visualizations can be interpreted clearly.

6. Time: I made sure to give users feedback on the amount of time it will take the page to load, by using a spinner. Sometimes it takes a  while for the visualizations to show up on the page, so the spinner lets the user know that nothing is broken, it's just going to take some time to work.
